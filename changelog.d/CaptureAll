synopsis: Bugfix - CaptureAll produces [""] for empty paths due to trailing slash.
prs: #1516
issues: #1243

description: {

CaptureAll resulted in `[""]` for empty paths due to trailing slash.  Similar
oddities occurred around these edge cases like `"/"` resulted in `[]` correctly,
but `"//"` resulted in `["", ""]`.  This patch simply eliminates the first `""`
in the pathinfo list as taken from the wai response.  This might break user
code that relies on personal shims to solve the problem, however simply removing their
workarounds should fix their code as the behavior is now sane.
